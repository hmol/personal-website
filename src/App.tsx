          I work as a developer and I like to solve problems using technology.
          I'm most comfortable in the back-end, but will get satisfaction from having the responsibility 
          for a software feature and developing it all the way from the database up to the GUI.
        </p>
        <p className="intro-sub">
          Most of my work experience the latest years has been related to REST APIs and also integration with other external systems, using python or C#.
          My preferred dev-environment consists of these vital parts: Ubuntu, Visual Studio Code, Docker and Git.

        <h2>Some thoughts on software development</h2>
        <p className="intro-sub"> 
          <h3>Readable code</h3>
          Code is often written one time and read a countless times. This is why I like readable code.
        </p>
        <p className="intro-sub">
          <h3>Test driven development</h3>
          I like having unit tests for the most businiss crucial functions in the system. In my experience these tests will also serve as a form of documentation and force the developer to write readable code. I do not like extreme TDD where the goal is 100% testcoverage. It is utopia and impossible to maintain.
        </p>
        <p className="intro-sub">
        <h3>KISS</h3>
          Keep it simple stupid is my main mantra. This is because it is so easy to do overengineering in software development. I will always try to start out simple and then do iterations, refractor and extend the code if necessary.

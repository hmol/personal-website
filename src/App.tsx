          I work as a fullstack developer. My main experience is with developing APIs in dotnet/c# with Angular in the frontend. 
          I also have a lot of experience setting up build and deployment pipelines.
          Currently I think nodejs, docker and graphql is exciting technologies that I try to learn more about.
          My current favourite developer environment consists of these vital parts: Ubuntu, Visual Studio Code, Rider, Docker and Git.

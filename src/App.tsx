          I work as a fullstack developer. My main experience is with developing REST-APIs in dotnet with Angular in the frontend. 
          Currently I think nodejs, docker and graphql is exciting technologies that I will try to learn more about.
          My preferred dev-environment consists of these vital parts: Ubuntu, Visual Studio Code, Rider, Docker and Git.

          Code is often written one time and read a countless times. This is why I like readable code.
          I do not like 100% testcoverage. It is utopia and impossible to maintain. 
          On the other hand, I like having unit tests for the most businiss crucial functions in the system.           
          In my experience these tests will also serve as a form of documentation and force the developer to write readable code.
